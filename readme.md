# STM32上的FOC库

本项目是基于STM32(STM32F401CC)的C语言版FOC库。

This project is based on the STM32 (STM32F401CC) C version of the FOC library.



V1.4之前是参考灯哥开源的DengFOC的自写库截至位置-速度闭环，之后版本接入simpleFOC，并完成有感电流环，基本完成有感专项。

Before V1.4, it was a reference to Dengfoc's open-source self-writing library cut-off position-speed closed loop, and then the version was connected to simpleFOC, and the induced current loop was completed, and the inducted special project was basically completed.



期待各位的Star，您的每一份Star都是我开源的动力。

Looking forward to all of you's Star, every one of your Star is the driving force for my open source.



项目参考野火FreeRTOS、灯哥开源的DengFOC和CSDN loop222博主，在此由衷感谢。

The project refers to Wildfire FreeRTOS, DengFOC and CSDN loop222 bloggers.
